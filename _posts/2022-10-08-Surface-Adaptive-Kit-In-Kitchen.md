title: Adaptive Kit in the Kitchen

## My Microwave Setup
I'm a huge fan!
My favorite markers in the kit are the dots, circles, +, and - . Those are amazing- so easy to distinguish from each other. I always run out of those first. Also they don't poke me under my fingernails like the key cover stickers do.  I've used 3 adaptive kits worth of markers on my home and work PCs. I love showing off my [standard setup](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/healthcare-and-life-sciences/keyboard-accessibility-with-microsoft-surface-adaptive-kit/ba-p/3301857). 

When I got a new microwave I didn't use bump dots, but instead used adaptive kit stickers. Because they are flat, have distinct shapes and are durable to key presses. I will very soon know if they resist steam and cleaning solvents.

I thought the microwave setup might interest readers. Now, not only has the adaptive kit improved my typing efficiency but it's improved my lunch time reheating efficiency! 

Here's a picture of my microwave setup.
The picture shows a microwave keypad. At the top a dot marker is on top of the "+30 seconds" button. A line with negative slope is on top of the "vent" button. A line with positive slope is on the "light" button. An X is on the "Stop/Cancel" button. And a circle is on the "start" button. The microwave has a several other buttons that are not labeled with adaptive kit markers: popcorn, sensor cook, turntable on/off and a bunch of other buttons that I don't use,
